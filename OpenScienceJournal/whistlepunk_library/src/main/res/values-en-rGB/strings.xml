  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_light">The ambient light sensor measures light in lux, a measure of illumination that depends on the amount of incoming light and the area over which it is spread. \n\nA full moon provides about 1 lux of illumination, a typical lamp-lit living room about 50 lux, classroom lighting and sunrise and sunset about 400 lux, daylight (indirect sun) over 10,000 lux, and direct sun over 30,000 lux. \n\nLux is an unfamiliar unit for most of us. When we buy lightbulbs, we often shop by watts, but the wattage of a bulb doesn\'t tell you how bright a bulb is, only how much energy it uses. Lumens are a better measure for light shopping; they tell you how much light a bulb will actually produce. Lux, meanwhile, tells you how much of that light arrives at a particular area.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_second_paragraph_light">Since light spreads out as it travels, the number of lux dwindles as you back away from a light source, even though the source is still emitting the same amount of light in lumens. An area that is tilted away from a light sources also receives less illumination, which happens to be why the equatorial regions here on Earth are so much warmer than the chilly poles. \n\nBy the way, the purpose of the light sensor in your phone is to control the light level of the screen, adjusting accordingly to dim and bright environments. Inside the light sensor, a tiny semiconductor responds to incoming light by producing a small but measurable electrical current, a phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect. Similar sensors are used in some street lights to turn them on when it gets dark outside.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_magnetic_strength">Your phone contains a device designed to detect magnetic fields: a magnetometer. This tiny, three-axis sensor that uses electric currents to detect the magnetic field strength in the three dimensions of space. By combining data from all three axes we can create a total magnetic field strength sensor. \n\nSome magnetometers detect magnetic fields using the Hall effect – the tendency of magnetic fields to deflect moving charge as it flows. Newer magnetometers rely on magnetoresistors, metal alloys that change their resistance in response to magnetic fields. \n\nWhy does a phone need a magnetometer? Knowing your orientation in space is useful for built-in compass and navigation apps, especially those that seek to give turn-by-turn directions.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_second_paragraph_magnetic_strength">Magnets, electric currents and metal objects will easily steer your phone\'s magnetometer this way and that. But even in the middle of an empty field, the magnetometer in your phone always shows a low, non-zero reading: this is the Earth\'s magnetic field!</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_acc">Objects have a tendency to stay put, or to keep moving if they\'re moving – we call this tendency inertia. Newton\'s First Law expresses this idea formally: An object continues in its state of motion or rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. \n\nWhen an unbalanced force does cause an object to budge, we say the object accelerates: its velocity, or speed, changes – either by speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. Acceleration is measured as a change of velocity (metres per second) in time, or metres per second squared (m/s²). \n\nYour phone has a device to measure these changes in motion – an accelerometer. Inside an accelerometer, small suspended masses are free to move. Changes in motion cause these masses to shift, much as your own head tends to flop forward when you\'re in a car that stops suddenly. Measuring these subtle inertial shifts, an accelerometer in a phone can detect changes in motion and orientation, useful for switching the screen from landscape to portrait mode, for playing games on your phone and more.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_second_paragraph_acc">You probably noticed a persistent acceleration in the Z axis, even with the phone sitting still on a table. This is the acceleration we experience here at the Earth\'s surface due to the pull of gravity, approximately 9.8 m/s².</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_decibel">Sounds are made by vibration. Your voice, for example, comes from vibrations in your throat\'s vocal cords. These vibrations create alternating zones of high and low air pressure that travel outward – much like the expanding circular ripple made by a pebble thrown into a pond.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_second_paragraph_decibel">All sounds can be described in terms of their frequency and intensity. \n\nIntensity is what you measure here with the Science Journal sound intensity sensor, in units of decibels (dB). Intensity, or loudness, depends on the distance that a vibrating object moves each time it vibrates; we hear greater intensity as increased loudness. \n\nThe frequency (also, pitch or tone) of a sound wave is equivalent to its rate of vibration. The faster an object vibrates, the higher the pitch of the resulting sound. The Science Journal sound intensity sensor does not measure frequency, only loudness. \n\nOne important thing to know is that the microphone in your device is designed to be very sensitive to differences in sound waves over time, but not the absolute size of each wave. We have tried to choose code that is likely to produce numbers similar to the reference numbers shown below, but each device may give consistently higher or lower numbers. Scientists will usually calibrate a sensor like this to a known measurement. For now, Science Journal can tell you whether your next train ride is louder than your next rock concert, but only if you bring the same phone to both events. \n\nAnother thing to know is that there are important differences between \'sound intensity\', \'sound intensity level\' and \'sound pressure\'. We are treating them here as the same thing, but if you want to dig deeper, there are many online resources about the differences. \n\nThe quietest sound that the average human ear can detect is defined as 0 dB. Ordinary conversation corresponds to about 60 dB, and sounds above about 140 dB are painful to the human ear. But sounds don\'t have to be painful to be harmful. Continued exposure to sounds of 90 dB – about the loudness of a vacuum cleaner – can eventually cause hearing loss. \n\nThe decibel scale is logarithmic, which makes for some trickiness: A sound source of 40 dB isn\'t twice as intense as one with 20 dB, it\'s 100 times more intense. Meanwhile, if one ringing alarm clock produces 70 dB, two ringing alarm clocks produce not 140 dB, but 73 dB. Like we said, it\'s a strange scale. \n\n10 dB rustling leaves \n20 dB whispering at 1.5 metres \n30 dB soft whisper \n50 dB rainfall \n60 dB normal conversation \n90 dB blender \n100 dB car without silencer \n110 dB shouting in ear \n120 dB thunder \n130 dB pneumatic drill \n140 dB aeroplane taking off</string>

The frequency (also, pitch or tone) of a sound wave is equivalent to its rate of vibration. The faster an object vibrates, the higher the pitch of the resulting sound. We measure these vibrations in Hertz (Hz) where 1 Hertz = 1 vibration/second. \n\nHumans can hear sounds in the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz. The lowest key on a piano produces a sound with a frequency of 27.5 Hz and the highest key produces a sound with a frequency of 4186.01 Hz. \n\nThe red dot indicates how close the detected pitch is to the nearest musical note. If the pitch is lower or \'flatter\', the dot will appear to the left. If the pitch is higher or \'sharper\', then the red dot will appear to the right.</string>

  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_raw">The data displayed here is coming from an external sensor communication with your phone via Bluetooth. \n\nThe value shows the percentage of the raw reading directly from your microcontroller.

  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_barometer">Although we rarely notice it, all of us live at the bottom of a deep ocean of air: Earth\'s atmosphere, which extends upwards of 40 kilometres (130,000 feet) high. The weight of all that air pushing down on us from above us creates what\'s called atmospheric pressure. \n\nAt sea level, atmospheric pressure applies 10 newtons of force on every square centimetre – that\'s the equivalent of about 6320 newtons on an area the size of a standard A4 sheet of paper.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_second_paragraph_barometer">We don\'t notice this crushing pressure because we\'re used to it – that is, until it changes, even slightly, as it does when we visit high altitudes or travel in aeroplanes. Atmospheric pressure also varies with weather conditions, dropping in the presence of stormy, unstable air, and rising when air stabilises and skies clear. \n\nThe digital barometer in your phone measures atmospheric pressure in hectopascals. (A hectopascal is 100 pascals, where a pascal is one newton of force applied over a square metre of area.) You\'ve probably heard weather forecasters give atmospheric pressure in millibars – this friendlier-sounding unit is equivalent to hectopascals. \n\nYou might be wondering: Why would a phone measure pressure? Atmospheric pressure changes measurably with even slight changes in elevation – say, when you climb a flight of stairs. So a digital barometer in a phone can help detect location changes, for example, telling you what floor of a building you are on, or whether you are driving on the upper or lower deck of a bridge.</string>

  <string name="sensor_desc_short_compass">The orientation of the phone with respect to Earth\'s magnetic field.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_compass">You probably already knew that the Earth has a magnetic field. What you may not have realised is that your phone contains a device designed to detect magnetic fields: a magnetometer. By combining data from your phone\'s magnetometer with the phone\'s orientation in space, we can create a digital compass. \n\nAn old-fashioned compass is a low-tech magnetometer, with a magnetised needle that turns to align itself with the surrounding magnetic field. There\'s no tiny compass inside your phone, but instead a tiny three-axis sensor that uses electric currents to detect the magnetic field strength in the three dimensions of space. But this alone is not enough to create a compass! \n\nWhy does a compass need to combine the data from the magnetometer with the phones orientation? Knowing the phone\'s orientation allows us to compute the magnetic rotation even when the phone is not held flat in the same plane as the Earth\'s magnetic field. We know that gravity is perpendicular to Earth\'s magnetic field, so we can use the direction of gravity from the accelerometer sensors to determine how much of the magnetic field is in the same plane as the Earth\'s magnetic field.</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_second_paragraph_compass">As you may have noticed, the compass responds not just to the Earth\'s magnetic field, but also to any and every magnetic field that happens to be around. Magnets, electric currents and metal objects will easily steer your phone\'s magnetometer this way and that, causing the compass reading to change. Stand in an open area – preferably outdoors and far from power lines – if you want to be sure that your compass\'s red tip is aligning with the Earth\'s magnetic field. It helps to move your phone in a figure-eight pattern to calibrate the magnetometer in your phone.</string>

  <string name="linear_accelerometer">Linear accelerometer</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_short_linear_acc">The total acceleration of the phone, excluding the force of gravity, in m/s²</string>
  <string name="sensor_desc_first_paragraph_linear_acc">Objects have a tendency to stay put, or to keep moving if they\'re moving – we call this tendency inertia. Newton\'s First Law expresses this idea formally: an object continues in its state of motion or rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. \n\nWhen an unbalanced force does cause an object to budge, we say that the object accelerates: its velocity, or speed, changes – either by speeding up, slowing down or changing direction. Acceleration is measured as a change of velocity (metres per second) in time, or metres per second squared (m/s²). \n\nYour phone has a device to measure these changes in motion – an accelerometer. Inside an accelerometer, small suspended masses are free to move. Changes in motion cause these masses to shift, much as your own head tends to flop forward when you\'re in a car that stops suddenly. Measuring these subtle inertial shifts, an accelerometer in a phone can detect changes in motion and orientation, useful for switching the screen from landscape to portrait mode, for playing games on your phone, and more.</string>
